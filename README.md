### Hi there 

I'm a 30-something full stack developer living just outside Philadelphia, PA. I've spent my career so far heavy in the .NET stack and Javascript, but have dabbled in PHP, Ruby on Rails, & Node.js. I'm also getting more comfortable with Node.js & React.

I just Released...

#### [Where Do You Want to Eat 2](https://github.com/kpwags/Where-Do-You-Want-To-Eat-2)

This is a little whimsical app that helps you choose where to eat. Enter some restaurants, tag them, and let the app tell you where you're getting your next meal. It is built using ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core. It also uses Bootstrap for the UI.

I'm currently working on two projects...

#### [Digital Family Cookbook](https://github.com/kpwags/digitalfamilycookbook)

This is currently a work in progress. The finished product will be a content management system for families to keep and share their recipes. This has been a learning project for me to teach myself React, Node.js & GraphQL. I also use Next.js & Apollo GraphQL. I just need to build out the homepage & documentation before I can release the first version.

#### Unnamed Project (Fitness Tracker)

This is also in the very early phases of development. Earlier in the year, I wrote a [blog post on how I track my fitness journey](https://kpwags.com/2020/01/21/tracking-my-fitness-journey.html). I decided to start working on a web app to do it for me to move away from some of my Excel Spreadsheets. I'm building it using .NET Core & Microsoft SQL Server on the backend and React & TypeScript on the frontend. It's my first time using TypeScript and has been somewhat of a learning adjustment for me. I'm keeping the source private for the moment, but am considering live-streaming some of my development.
