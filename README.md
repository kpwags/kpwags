### Hi there 

I'm a 30-something full stack developer living just outside Philadelphia, PA. I've spent my career so far heavy in the .NET stack, but have dabbled in PHP & Ruby on Rails. I'm also getting more comfortable with Node.js & React.

I just Released...

#### [Where Do You Want to Eat 2](https://github.com/kpwags/Where-Do-You-Want-To-Eat-2)

This is a little whimsical app that helps you choose where to eat. Enter some restaurants, tag them, and let the app tell you where you're getting your next meal. It is built using ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core. It also uses Bootstrap for the UI.

I'm currently working on two projects...

#### [Digital Family Cookbook](https://github.com/kpwags/digitalfamilycookbook)

This is currently a work in progress. The finished product will be a content management system for families to keep and share their recipes. This has been a learning project for me to teach myself React, Node.js & GraphQL. I also use Next.js & Apollo GraphQL.

#### [WagsReader](https://github.com/kpwags/WagsReader)

This is also in the very early phases of development. It's meant to help get more comfortable with building mobile apps using Xamarin. I'm also working with the .NET Core Web API with this project.
