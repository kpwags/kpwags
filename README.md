# Hi there 

I'm a 40-something full stack developer living just outside Philadelphia, PA.

## Current Work

### [Digital Family Cookbook](https://github.com/kpwags/digital-family-cookbook)

This is currently a work in progress, but it's near its end. It's written in React/TypeScript with a .NET API backend.

### League Management System

This is in the early stages. It's a web application meant to allow for sports leagues to manage themselves. It's being built in .NET 8 utilizing Blazor.
